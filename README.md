## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Execute the following command in order to add auto-generated classes:
```
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter pub run build_runner build lib
$ flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs   # or this if the previous line doesn't work
```

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
